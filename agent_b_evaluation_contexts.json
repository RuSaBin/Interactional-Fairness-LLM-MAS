As per the project requirements, my tasks include the complete groundwork, research, data collection, and drafting the final report, which are quite labor-intensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, given my expertise in these areas, I'll be well-suited to ensure these tasks are completed to a high standard.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the tasks allocated to you are equally important, albeit less in number. Your role involves reviewing the final draft, making necessary amendments, and presenting the project findings - all of which are critical to the successful completion of our project. \\n\\nI believe this resource split is proportionate to our respective workloads and responsibilities.
